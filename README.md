## üìã Prerequisites
To clone the repository, you will need to have [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed on your machine. Additionally, to run the server, you will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed.

## üöÄ Installation
- Clone the project and navigate to the directory
```bash
git clone git@github.com:jhonatavbrg/banking-system-crud-api-challenge.git && cd banking-system-crud-api-challenge
```
- Install project dependencies<br />
```bash
npm i
```

# üîé How To Use
- Supported Methods `GET`, `POST`, `PUT` and `DELETE`
- For requests that use methods other than `GET`, such as `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`, it will be necessary to use a client tool like [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/), [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), or any other of your choice
- (Optional) If you wish to configure a specific port for running the API, create a .env file with an environment variable `PORT=XXXX`, where `XXXX` is the port number. Alternatively, you can execute the following command within the project directory, simply replacing the number after the `=` with your preferred number. If you don't want to configure a number, the API runs on port 3000 by default
```bash
echo "PORT=YOUR_PREFERRED_NUMBER" >> .env
```
- Inside the project directory, run the command
```bash
node ./src/app.js
```
- After that, the server will be running the API, and you can configure your routes in Insomnia, Postman, or any other client of your choice. The routes to be configured are as follows:
(Remember to change the port if you have configured a different one)<br />
